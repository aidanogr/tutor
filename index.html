      <h1>About Aggie Business Tutors</h1>
      <p>Hi! I’m Brady Dinkel, the founder of Aggie Business Tutors. It sounds fancy, but simply
        put, I’m just one student helping another to succeed.
        I started tutoring ACCT 229 while I was in the midst of taking the course with friends
        who were having a bit of a tough time breaking down the content. It’s a fast-paced class
        with lots of stuff to cram in, so it can be challenging to keep pace.
        Beginning to tutor ACCT 229 was one of the best decisions I made my freshmen year.
        As a young entrepreneur, I have spent time trying various businesses; tutoring is the
        one my heart and soul is in.
        As a bonus, I’m just a nerd. Accounting makes sense to me and I enjoy it. I hope that
        after going through tutoring with Aggie Business Tutors, students will feel the same
        about ACCT 229 and business in general.</p>

      <h1>Client Testimonials</h1>
      <p>“Brady always made sure I understood the topic by going over it several times. He even
        went as far as to make original worksheets for us to practice concepts with. He
        instituted a refund policy in case we did not do as well as we hoped, going above and
        beyond the duties of a normal tutor.”</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h1>Client Testimonials</h1>
      <p>“I was struggling in ACCT 229, but luckily a very good friend of mine was good at it. I
        asked for his help and soon enough found out I wasn’t the only one. Brady is a very
        intelligent, bright individual who had worked out practice problems in his free time to
        help answer our questions. Not to mention, he was still taking ACCT along with other
        classes. He gave us very good advice, great practice problems, and many different
        ways to approach specific problems. I wish I had started studying with him sooner!”</p>

      <h1>Client Testimonials</h1>
      <p>“I would always fill in my notes during class time for ACCT 229, but Brady helped me
        fully understand what I was writing down. He helped me prepare for exams by reviewing
        material and providing relevant sample questions, even outside of those from the
        textbook. He’s very good at breaking down confusing concepts into simple, more
        memorable terms, and I highly recommend him.”</p>
